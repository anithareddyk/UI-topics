/*Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.Loops are handy,
 if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.*/

 /*JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
The For Loop syntax
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    code block to be executed
}*/
