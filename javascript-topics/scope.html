<p>The local variable Name cannot be accessed from code outside the function:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
myFunction();
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The type of carName is " + typeof Name;

function myFunction() {

/*Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.
Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
