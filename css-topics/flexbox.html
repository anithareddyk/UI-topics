<h3>Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably 
    when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.

For many applications, the flexible box model provides an improvement over
 the block model in that it does not use floats, nor do the flex container's
 margins collapse with the margins of its contents.</h3>
 <h4>Flexbox consists of flex containers and flex items.
A flex container is declared by setting the display property of 
an element to either flex (rendered as a block) or inline-flex (rendered as inline).
Inside a flex container there is one or more flex items.</h4>
<h5>Flex items are positioned inside a flex container along a flex line.
     By default there is only one flex line per flex container.</h5>
