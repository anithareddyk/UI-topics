// When it comes to inheritance, 
// JavaScript only has one construct: 
// objects. Each object has an internal 
// link to another object called its prototype. 
// That prototype object has a prototype of its own,
//  and so on until an object is reached 
// with null as its prototype. By definition, 
// null has no prototype, and acts 
// as the final link in this prototype chain.
// something like FRP.
