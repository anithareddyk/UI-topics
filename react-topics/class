class is used for  Auto-Binding for your React components.
$ npm install react-class --save

Instead of extending React.Component you have to extend the class exported by react-class.
example:
import Component from 'react-class'
 or import { Component } from 'react-class
 
class MyApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div {...props} onClick={this.onClick}>
      //onClick is auto-bound to "this", so you can keep your code dry
    </div>
  }
 
  onClick(){
    console.log(this)
    // this is correctly bound to the component instance
  }
}
